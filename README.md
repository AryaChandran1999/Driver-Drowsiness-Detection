# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection

Driver drowsiness technology is a safety technology to prevent car
accidents caused by drivers who fall asleep while driving. The objective of this Python project is to build a drowsiness
detection system that will detect if a driver is drowsy depending
on if the personâ€™s eyes are closed for a particular time period . This
system will alert the driver when drowsiness is detected.
